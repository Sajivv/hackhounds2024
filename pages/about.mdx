## Health/Environment

Make something that helps the environment. It may seem like a hard thing, but remember, the small things count! Ship projects that count someone's carbon emissions, or tell you the truth about each state's pollution regulations. Be creative -- what does the environment mean to you? It doesn't have to be just the greenery, it could be how other people interact, or how the people around you behave.

# We’re driven by a mission.

HackHounds is dedicated in encourage students to learn computer science—at just the age where they're interested in technology and programming.

100+ students of all skill levels will assemble for a weekend of collaboration and innovation, each building apps/websites/games that give back to the community in 24 hours. Then judges will select the winning projects and teams.

# Coding is a superpower.

Starting to code has a lasting impact. Once you begin coding, you switch from being a consumer to being a creator. We want to make everyone a creator—it’s a magical transformation. You can solve problems your way, bounded only by your imagination.

We know this because we’re [computer science students at Loyola](https://www.loyola.edu/academics/computer-science/), where we have good infrastructure for students to learn to code. Now, we want to bring that experience to everyone. This is a hackathon by the students, for the students, and for the future of all of Baltimore.
